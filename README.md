## I. Rationale

Design Tech is a profoundly interdisciplinary program that encourages students to explore the experimental boundaries and intersections between disciplines. While this exploration can lead to radical innovation, the approach must also include a thorough understanding of adjacent disciplines, communities of practice, affordances of technologies, and professional competencies. This class is a deep dive into a project that explores the frontiers of design and technology. By developing and documenting the production of 'radical prototypes', this course asks students to envision and speculate on the potential innovations proposed by their research. Learning from fields such as speculative fiction and anchoring speculation with cartographies of interdependence, this class intends to produce a productive roadmap for the further development of students' research.

The specialization project serves as both a pedagogical vehicle and a professional development opportunity. By engaging with real-world problems and stakeholders, students will cultivate the skills to translate theoretical insights into implementable solutions while maintaining a reflective, critical stance toward their own practice. This approach prepares students to become thoughtful practitioners who can balance innovation with responsibility, speculation with feasibility, and individual vision with collective impact.


### Developing Radical Prototypes

Drawing inspiration from the "radical software" movement of the 1970s—which fundamentally reimagined the relationship between technology, media, and society—this course positions prototyping as a critical practice that challenges existing technological paradigms rather than simply optimizing them. A "radical prototype" in this context is not merely a proof of concept or a market-ready solution, but an intervention that questions the underlying assumptions, power structures, and value systems embedded in contemporary technology.

Through hands-on making, students will engage in what we call "critical prototyping"—a recursive process where speculation, material experimentation, and reflexive analysis inform one another. Each prototype serves simultaneously as a functional demonstration, a theoretical argument, and a provocation that asks: What alternative relationships between humans, technology, and society might be possible?

Students will develop working prototypes that embody different logics than those driving mainstream technology development—perhaps prioritizing communal ownership over individual property, mutual aid over competitive advantage, or ecological reciprocity over extractive efficiency. This approach demands that students not only master technical skills but also develop the critical acuity to recognize how their design decisions encode particular worldviews and political possibilities.

By creating artifacts that make alternative futures tangible and debatable, students will learn to wield technology as a medium for cultural critique and social transformation, continuing the radical software tradition of using technical tools to reprogram society itself.

## II. Course Aims and Objectives

### Aims
This course is intended to help students deepen their interest in their project. It is designed to eliminate blind spots and broaden awareness of how related disciplines have addressed recurring problems, as well as to identify the current state of the art in technology, with particular attention to the critical friction involved in implementation.

During this two-semester requirement, you will work closely with Cornell Tech and AAP faculty and research staff to conduct research on a critical design and technology question or problem and develop an implementable design tech solution for a real human need. Specialization projects take various forms, but every project results in tangible, marketable experience and a completed project that will stand out on your resume. The first semester focuses on the development of a project question, literature review, team building, research methods, and identifying your audience.

### Specific Learning Objectives

#### Learning Outcomes:
1. Demonstrate understanding of research methods and writing
2. Develop a focused specialization project question
3. Demonstrate team-building and collaborative skills
4. Demonstrate understanding of a research methodology
5. Demonstrate understanding of your audience and the field that you are contributing to through literature review and interviews

## III. Format and Procedures

Each class will be structured around a short lecture, followed by reading responses and conversations on the themes of the week, and an update report from each team on the progress of their specialization project.

This course requires students to work in teams of 2-3 members, reflecting the inherently collaborative nature of design technology practice and the radical software tradition's emphasis on collective action over individual authorship. Teams will be formed by Session 3, allowing time for students to identify shared interests and complementary skills through initial exercises and discussions.

The course will require teams to document their project through a GitHub Repository and a website. Each week, we will expect an update to the website that reflects the team's latest developments and documents experiments or prototypes developed. The course will follow a format of public-facing research, considering how the sharing of resources across class participants can contribute to a 'computational commons', a shared infrastructure of ideas and know-how that can propagate laterally between students and within the school.

The course adopts a 'fertile soil' approach to ideas and innovation, focusing on the documentation of projects through tutorials, Instructables, learning paths, and examples. Means of making knowledge demonstrable and reproducible.

The students are expected to participate in discussions and comment on each other's work, offering insights on technologies or critical questions that might be important to address. Participation will be part of your final grade.
